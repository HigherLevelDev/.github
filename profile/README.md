# Higher Level Dev

Welcome to **Higher Level Dev** on GitHub!

We are a boutique consultancy dedicated to revolutionizing software development through AI-augmented tools and workflows. Our mission is to radically improve developer productivity by leveraging cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) and innovative development methodologies.

## About Us

At Higher Level Dev, we believe in developing software at a higher levelâ€”using natural language to define specifications and allowing AI agents to handle the coding details. Our **[Higher Level Dev Kit](https://github.com/HigherLevelDev/hldk)** empowers developers to:

- **Supercharge productivity**: Automate code generation, refactoring, and testing.
- **Leverage AI agents**: Transform concise, natural language specs into working code using LLM-powered agents.
- **Adapt seamlessly**: Apply our toolkit across various tech stacks, including Java, Node.js, .NET, Python, Go, mobile apps, and modern frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.
